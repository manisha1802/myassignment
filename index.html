           <h3>MOMOS</h3>
     <img class="img"src="https://greenbowl2soul.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/veg-momos_7-500x375.jpg"alt="momos"height="300"width="500">
      <br>
   <p class="odd">   Today, there are food entrepreneurs who prepare momos in bulk and supply them to vendors and kiosks whose only job is to steam and sell them piping hot with hot sauce to hungry customers who never seem to get enough of them. There was a time, not too long ago, when people associated momos with food from the Northeast. Far from it, it’s not really a part of their traditional cuisine. For instance, in Manipur's capital Imphal, restaurants may now be awaking up to the popularity of this food and including them in their menu with passion, but they can never get it right simply because it is not a traditional dish like fish and rice is, as in the case in Tripura or other states in the region, with of course a few exceptions.Today, there are food entrepreneurs who prepare momos in bulk and supply them to vendors and kiosks whose only job is to steam and sell them piping hot with hot sauce to hungry customers who never seem to get enough of them.

           <h3>MANCHURIAN</h3>
<img class="img"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRoznLy2QSLmkY4XvKkeEjHS1M6O9uKDy5tsQ&usqp=CAU"alt="manchurian"height="300"width="500">
      <br>
  <p class="even">   Indo-Chinese food has a long history in India, and one of its most delicious chapters is doubtlessly the manchurian.

          This dish of vegetable dumplings in a glossy, rich-brown sauce with bold notes of tangy, sweet, spicy and salty is impossible to resist and I can honestly say I’ve never met a man, woman or child who could walk away from a plateful. In fact, if you ask an Indian what his or her favorite Indo-Chinese dish is, chances are, it would be a Veg Manchurian.

      <div>
           <h3>DOSA</h3>
<img class="img"src="https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2019/10/9/DV3016_masala-dosa_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1570635680579.jpeg"alt="dosa"height="300"width="500">
     <br>
 <p class="odd">   The outside of the Dosa, the crepe is soft and crispy at the same time. The special batter Dosas chef’s make is truly a thing. You can shred parts of the Dosa and taste it without knowing what you are actually eating. It is just delicious and makes you want to keep on eating the whole thing just like an authentic French baguette just out of the oven would make you feel.

           <h3>DHOKLA</h3>
<img class="img"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRmF4LmcjQ_N0mZKAHZPPiGR3S-HM_LGXQY5w&usqp=CAU"alt="dhokla"height="300"width="500">
    <br>
<p class="even">    Dhokla is a savoury cake made out of Bengal gram flour and is steamed to get a fluffy texture. The dish occupies pride of place in its state of origin — Gujarat, and has become a favourite across the country. It’s a low-calorie, healthy and protein-packed snack. It’s cooked with little or no oil and takes very little time to prepare. The fermentation of the flour enhances its nutritive value. Dhokla has a low glycemic index which makes it good for diabetics. Here are a few dhokla recipes and a tasty variation on the regular one.

           <h3>PIZZA</h3>
<img class="img"src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/216054.jpg"alt="pizza"height="300"width="500">
   <br>
 <p class="odd">     Today this dish is one of the most popular foods on the entire Earth, but that fame and recognition came from the decades of work of many international pizza restaurant franchises which spread this dish to the all four corners of the world. Before these pizza chains were formed, this dish slowly rose in popularity in the United Stated, brought from the Europe by the Italian settlers which did not wanted to be parted from one of the most iconic meals of their country. And there, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Naples, the modern Pizza was created.

           <h3>CHOLE-BHATURE</h3>
<img class="img"src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/ff515314282d0608/1200x630cq70/photo.jpg"alt="chole bhature"height="300"width="500">
    <br>
<p class="even">    At its core, chole bhature is a combination of two dishes: chole - a spicy chickpea curry, and bhature - a type of fried bread made with maida flour. Popular throughout North India, the dish was invented in Delhi in the 1940s.

       It is commonly accompanied by onions, pickles, mint chutney, and chilled lassi. Chole bhature can be found at most street carts in North India, but it can also be easily prepared at home. Although it can be eaten any time of the day, chole bhature is especially popular in the morning, when bhature are filled with potatoes or cottage cheese, making it a heavy, nutritious breakfast.
